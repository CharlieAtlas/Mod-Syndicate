	A Few Good Men is a minor rework to reduce starting soldiers while increasing their
	effectiveness.  It also modifies the game to allow build up back to regular LW sized
	squads over time.

			This modifies a select few items of gameplay.

Starting Stats:
-Soldiers start with better stats than vanilla LW
-AIM + 5
-WILL + 5
-Defense + 2
-Mobility + 1
-HP + 1

Number of Soldiers:
You start out with significantly less soldiers in your campaign.  Early game balances nicely
with the increased stats, but towards mid-game if you haven't upgraded your skyranger capacity
the sheer number of enemies will overwhelm you.
-First OTS upgrade now adds 2 squad spots
-Second OTS upgrade still only adds 1
-Research of Super Skyranger instantly adds 2 squad spots on top of existing special mission
