Soldier Cost: The soldier cost starts out the same as you have it set in DGC.ini, however,
	once you purchase an OTS upgrade to be able to recruit higher ranked soldiers the cost
	also increases:
	Rookie: DGC.ini setting
	Specialist: DGC * 2.5
	Lance Corporal: DGC * 4
	Corporal: DGC * 4.5
	Sergeant: DGC * 5

Each OTS Upgrade requires it's prior rank upgrade to have already been completed.  There is a total
number of ranks limit as well as an associated cost for the upgrade(you copy/paste it from the
INSTALL.txt file in the download folder.
