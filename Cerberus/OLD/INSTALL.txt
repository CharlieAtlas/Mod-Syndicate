===================================================
==        PROJECT CERBERUS INSTALLATION          ==
===================================================

Project Cerberus requires you to have previously downloaded the Long War mod in order to be installed.
This mod is compatible for install with PatcherGUI

Project Cerberus requires a clean install of XCom The Long War Mod.  Due to the massive amount
of .ini, .int, and code changes this mod may not be compatible with other mods.

If there are mods that you really enjoy and would like to know if they are compatible with Project
Cerberus you can contact me via nexusmods.com via private message.

NEW INSTALLATION STEPS

1. Copy Cerberus.txt into your Mods folder and select & install it with your
   other mods using PatcherGUI

2. Copy AlternateTechTree.u into your XEW\XComGame\CookedPCConsole folder.  
   e.g. C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\SteamApps\Common\XCom-Enemy-Unknown\XEW\XComGame\CookedPCConsole
   
   *IMPORTANT: Don't forget the "XEW", otherwise you're installing it into 
   the EU folder and this won't work!*

4. Edit XEW\XComGame\Config\DefaultMutatorLoader.ini and add the following lines to the
   bottom of the file:

        arrStrategicMutators="AlternateTechTree.AltTechTreeMutate"
	arrStrategicMutators="AlternateTechTree.AltTechTree"
	arrStrategicMutators="AlternateTechTree.AltItemTree"
	NOTE: I have included DefaultMutatorLoader.ini in the install file in case you're curious
		how it needs to look.

5. Copy XComGame.int** & XComStrategyGame.int into XEW\XComGame\Localization\INT folder.  Once again 
   'Localization' should be a sibling folder to the CookedPCConsole folder.

** There are 2 new 2nd Wave options included in this file, both are required in order to participate in
   all parts of this mod.  They need to be in the correct order and are as follows:

	m_arrGameplayToggleTitle[30]="Alternate Tech Tree (#30)"
	m_arrGameplayToggleDesc[30]="Alternate Tech Tree reworks several key systems inside Xcom.  Research will become directional, if you choose a specific path other research options become unavailable.  Also many additional foundry projects become available and progression becomes more reliant on them."

	m_arrGameplayToggleTitle[31]="A Few Good Men (#31)"
	m_arrGameplayToggleDesc[31]="Instead of 6 soldiers you start with 5, also purchasing soldiers will now cost 100 and award you with a Specialist instead of a Rookie.  Last you will start with 60 soldiers instead of the set amount in DGC.ini.  WARNING USING THIS OPTION NEGATES YOUR CHANGES TO NUM_STARTING_SOLDIERS AND SOLDIER_COST!"
