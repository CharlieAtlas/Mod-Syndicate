	Features:
		Re-worked Research Tech Tree:  Tech Tree that has definable paths that 
		require choices, choosing specific techs will lock off access to others:
			-Beam, Pulse, and EMP are their own path
			-Advanced Ballistics, Gauss, and Fusion are their own path
			-Choosing Beam locks you off from Advanced Ballistics and subsequent 
				research
			-Choosing Advanced Ballistics locks you off from Beam and subsequent 
				research
			-Choosing Gene Mod Recovery locks you off from Mobile Combat 
				Exoskeletons and Heavy Combat Exoskeletons
			-Choosing Mobile Combat Exoskeletons or Heavy Combat Exoskeletons 
				locks you off from Gene Mod Recovery

	Re-defined Techs:  Certain techs have been modified in order to balance the different 
			   definable paths that only allow one direction choice
		-Gene Mod Recovery(removes Improved Combat Exoskeletons): reduces fatigue 
			penalty for Gene Mods
		-Advanced Fusion Weaponry(removes Vehicular Plasma Weapons): increases the 
			effectiveness of Fusion weapons
		-Advanced Ballistic Weaponry(removes Precision Plasma Weapons): increases the 
			effectiveness of Ballistic weapons
		-Advanced Cooling Technology(removes Heavy Plasma Weapons): used to 
			restructure unlocking of weapons and armor
		-Micro Techologies(removes Compact Plasma Weapons): used to restructure 
			unlocking of weapons and armor
		-Alien Cybernetics(removes Experimental Warfare): used to restructure 
			unlocking of weapons and armor

	Additional Foundry Projects:  In order to restructure the gameplay in a unique way 
				      I have created additional foundry projects which is 
				      what will be used to unlock different tiers of weapons
		-MEC Exoskeleton Advancements
		-Improved MEC Defense Systems
		-Improved MEC Power Systems
		-Beam Cooling Systems
		-Beam Alloy Chasis
		-Advanced Beam Discharge
		-Improved Gauss Ammo Casing
		-Fused Gauss Chamber
		-Gauss Interchangable Core
		-Pulse Discharge Adaptation
		-Enhanced Pulse Charge
		-Enhanced Fusion Concepts

	Expanded OTS Upgrades:	I was always a fan of being able to recruit better soldiers as the
				game progressed after researching that OTS Upgrade, the one from
				vanilla that made all new recruits the rank of Squaddie instead of
				Rookie.  So I took that concept and ran with it, as the game progresses
				the rank of the new recruits can be increased using the following
				OTS Upgrades:
					-Extended Bootcamp
					-Specialist Training
					-Improved Training Facilities
					-Best of the Best

	Item Restructure:  Many of the item requirements have been changed to mix up the 
			   gameplay for those already familiar with how Long War works

	Current Focus:	Currently I have turned my attention to creating a new class(or classes)
			that work differently than the existing ones.  Perk trees will remain
			but there will be additional defining factors to make them feel different.
			The existing classes will still have their roles, something the new ones
			won't be designed to replace, but I want the new class(classes) to be more
			versatile.

	Other Ideas:	With XCom 2 getting closer and Fallout 4 getting modding support soon I'm
			starting to shift my focus away from XCom EU/EW.  Here are some ideas I've
			considered, but will only work on if there's some sort of demand for them:
